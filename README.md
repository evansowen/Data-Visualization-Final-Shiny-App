# DataVizWork-Shiny-App

As part of my Data Visualization course at Merrimack College I developed a functional shiny application to explore salary gender bias amongst various college majors 
(https://owen-evans.shinyapps.io/EvansOwen_DSA5200_FinalProject/)

This Shiny application was based upon data obtained from the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. This dataset provides information on the starting salaries, unemployment rate and underemployment rates for recent college graduates from 2010-2012.   The intent of the Shiny app was to provide the reader a high level of interactivity via the generation of detailed plotly outputs.    The application allows one to explore the possible presence of gender bias in starting salaries, as well as unemployment and underemployment rates.
