(https://owen-evans.shinyapps.io/EvansOwen_DSA5200_FinalProject/)

Utilized a recent college majors salary survey to explore possible gender biases in starting salary for various college majors.    The major intent was to determine whether gender starting salary bias was dependent on choice of college major.  

Work indicated that gender-gap in starting salary was evident and exacerbated for STEM related college majors.
